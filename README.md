Project Description*:

Medihelp Hospital System provides an easy and convient access of patient to doctor and easy to use through this website. The purpose   of   the   project   entitled   as  MediHelp HOSPITAL   MANAGEMENT   SYSTEM   is   to computerize the Front Office Management of Hospital to develop software which is user friendly,  simple,  fast,  and  cost –effective.  It  deals  with  the  collection  of  patient‟s information,  diagnosis  details,  etc.  Traditionally,  it  was  done  manually. The  main function  of  the  system  is  to  register  and  store  patient  details  and  doctor  details  and retrieve  these  details  as  and  when  required,  and  also  to  manipulate  these details meaningfully.  This  function  of  Hospital  Management  Information  System  deals  with registering  the  new  Patient  by  giving  unique  Identification  Number  to  the  Patient.  This number is unique throughout the System for identifying the patient. Simultaneous update and  changes  are  made  to  the  databases.  Identification  number  is  also  providedto  doctor to  retrieve  and  to  change  doctor  details.  The  software  is  used  by  administrator  or receptionist in the hospital. The software is secured by username and password, accessed by administrator or receptionist of the hospital.
